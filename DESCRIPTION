Description: Read and write PNG image data from raw vectors and files.
    Compression level when writing is configurable, thus allowing for 
    a tradeoff between file size and writing speed.
    This implementation is a wrapper around the 'libspng' 'C' library
    which is available from <https://github.com/randy408/libspng/>.
