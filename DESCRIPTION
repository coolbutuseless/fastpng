Description: Read and write PNG images with arrays, rasters, native
    rasters, numeric arrays, integer arrays, raw vectors and indexed
    values.  This PNG encoder exposes configurable internal options
    enabling the user to select a speed-size tradeoff.  For example,
    disabling compression can speed up writing PNG by a factor of 50.
    Multiple image formats are supported including raster, native rasters,
    and integer and numeric arrays at color depths of 1, 2, 3 or 4. 16-bit
    images are also supported. This implementation uses the 'libspng' 'C'
    library which is available from
    <https://github.com/randy408/libspng/>.
