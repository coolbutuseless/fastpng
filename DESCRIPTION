Description: Read and write image data in R to and from raw vectors and
    files.  Compression level when writing is configurable, allowing for a
    tradeoff between file size and writing speed.  This implementation is
    a wrapper around the 'libspng' 'C' library which is available from
    <https://github.com/randy408/libspng/>.
